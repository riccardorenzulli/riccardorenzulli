	abstract     = {Localization of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relies heavily on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which are susceptible to interference. Especially in security applications, robust localization algorithms independent of GNSS are needed to provide dependable operations of autonomous UAVs also in interfered conditions. Typical non-GNSS visual localization approaches rely on known starting pose, work only on a small-sized map, or require known flight paths before a mission starts. We consider the problem of localization with no information on initial pose or planned flight path. We propose a solution for global visual localization on large maps, based on matching orthoprojected UAV images to satellite imagery using learned season-invariant descriptors, and test with environment sizes up to 100 km2. We show that the method is able to determine heading, latitude and longitude of the UAV at 12.6–18.7 m lateral translation error in as few as 23.2–44.4 updates from an uninformed initialization, also in situations of significant seasonal appearance difference (winter–summer) between the UAV image and the map. We evaluate the characteristics of multiple neural network architectures for generating the descriptors, and likelihood estimation methods that are able to provide fast convergence and low localization error. We also evaluate the operation of the algorithm using real UAV data and evaluate running time on a real-time embedded platform. We believe this is the first work that is able to recover the pose of an UAV at this scale and rate of convergence, while allowing significant seasonal difference between camera observations and map.}

Promoting sparse topologies, for example, allows the deployment of deep neural networks models on embedded, resource-constrained devices. Recently, Capsule Networks were introduced to enhance explainability of a model, where each capsule is an explicit representation of an object or its parts. These models show promising results on toy datasets, but their low scalability prevents deployment on more complex tasks. In this work, we explore sparsity besides capsule representations to improve their computational efficiency by reducing the number of capsules. We show how pruning with Capsule Network achieves high generalization with less memory requirements, computational effort, and inference and training time.},

Capsule layers are dynamically connected by means of an iterative routing mechanism, which models the connection strengths between capsules from different layers. However, whether routing improves the network performance is still object of debate. This work tackles this issue via Routing Annealing (RA), where the number of routing iterations is annealed at training time. This proposal gives some insights on the effectiveness of the routing for Capsule Networks. Our experiments on different datasets and architectures show that RA yields better performance over a reference setup where the number of routing iterations is fixed (even in the limit case with no routing), especially for architectures with fewer parameters.}

Nonetheless, effectively training these deep networks remains challenging and resource-intensive. This paper investigates the efficacy of pruned deep learning models in transfer learning scenarios under extremely low memory budgets, tailored for TinyML models. Our study reveals that the source task's model with the highest activation entropy outperforms others in the target task. Motivated by this, we propose an entropy-based Efficient Neural Transfer with Reduced Overhead via PrunIng (ENTROPI) algorithm. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse models (ResNet18 and MobileNet-v3) and target datasets (CIFAR-100, VLCS, and PACS), we substantiate the superior generalization achieved by transfer learning from the entropy-pruned model. Quantitative measures for entropy provide valuable insights into the reasons behind the observed performance improvements. The results underscore ENTROPI's potential as an efficient solution for enhancing generalization in data-limited transfer learning tasks.}

Recent works have attempted to address these issues by including explicit volumetric information, which makes the optimization process difficult when fine-graining the voxel grids. In this paper, we propose an ensemble approach that combines the strengths of two NeRF models to achieve superior results compared to state-of-the-art architectures, with a similar number of parameters. Experimental results show that our ensemble approach is a promising strategy for performance enhancement, and beats vanilla approaches under the same parameter's cardinality constraint.},

	abstract     = {<sec>ObjectiveIn this study, we investigate whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can generate informative parametric maps from the pre-processed CT perfusion data in patients with acute ischemic stroke in a clinical setting.</sec><sec>MethodsThe CNN training was performed on a subset of 100 pre-processed perfusion CT dataset, while 15 samples were kept for testing. All the data used for the training/testing of the network and for generating ground truth (GT) maps, using a state-of-the-art deconvolution algorithm, were previously pre-processed using a pipeline for motion correction and filtering. Threefold cross validation had been used to estimate the performance of the model on unseen data, reporting Mean Squared Error (MSE). Maps accuracy had been checked through manual segmentation of infarct core and total hypo-perfused regions on both CNN-derived and GT maps. Concordance among segmented lesions was assessed using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Correlation and agreement among different perfusion analysis methods were evaluated using mean absolute volume differences, Pearson correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman analysis, and coefficient of repeatability across lesion volumes.</sec><sec>ResultsThe MSE was very low for two out of three maps, and low in the remaining map, showing good generalizability. Mean Dice scores from two different raters and the GT maps ranged from 0.80 to 0.87. Inter-rater concordance was high, and a strong correlation was found between lesion volumes of CNN maps and GT maps (0.99, 0.98, respectively).</sec><sec>ConclusionThe agreement between our CNN-based perfusion maps and the state-of-the-art deconvolution-algorithm perfusion analysis maps, highlights the potential of machine learning methods applied to perfusion analysis. CNN approaches can reduce the volume of data required by deconvolution algorithms to estimate the ischemic core, and thus might allow the development of novel perfusion protocols with lower radiation dose deployed to the patient.</sec>},
