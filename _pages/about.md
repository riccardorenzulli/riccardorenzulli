Hello, World!

I am fascinated by understanding and reasoning with **deep neural networks** (DNNs) and how we can enhance their cognitive plausibility. As different networks encode distinct assumptions, can we leverage these **inductive biases** to construct more robust models? For instance, is it possible to create networks that require less data and fewer parameters by modeling intricate objects as compositions of distinct parts?

To mention a bunch of keywords, I'm interested in *representation learning*, *object-centric learning*, *prototypical learning*, *shortcut learning*, *robustness*, *interpretability* and *foundation models*. Additionally, I'm keen on exploring diverse applications, such as medical image analysis and aerial/satellite imagery.

I received my **PhD** from **University of Turin** in 2023, advised by Prof. Marco Grangetto. My PhD research focused on **capsule networks**, which are deep learning models that encode objects into vector representations, called capsules, that can be used to model hierarchical relationships better.

In 2022, I spent six months at **Aalto University** (Helsinki, Finland), supervised by Prof. Ville Kyrki and Francesco Verdoja, where I developed a system for non-GNSS visual localization of UAVs.

In 2018-2019, I also worked for some artificial intelligence companies as **deep learning scientist**.

I received my master's and bachelor's degrees at the Computer Science Department of the University of Turin. My previous research advisor was Prof. Valentina Gliozzi, who introduced me to *description logics*, *non-monotonic reasoning* and *prototypical representations*.

[Collaborations!](https://riccardorenzulli.github.io) I am **looking for collaborations**, so if you are interested or you want to have a constructive discussion chat, please drop me an email (riccardo.renzulli@unito.it).
